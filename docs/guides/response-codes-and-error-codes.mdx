A quick reference for the standard HTTP response status codes and JSON-RPC error codes which you may encounter during the development process.

## HTTP Response Status Codes

:::info

HTTP status codes are three-digit responses from a server to a client request.

These status codes are grouped into 5 different categories:

1. 1xx - [Informational Responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#information_responses)

2. 2xx - [Successful Responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#successful_responses)

3. 3xx - [Redirection Messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages)

4. 4xx - [Client Error Responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses)

5. 5xx - [Server Error Responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#server_error_responses)

### Common HTTP Status Codes

| Code    | Message               | Meaning                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------ | :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **200** | OK                    | The request succeeded.                                                                                                                                      |
| **400** | Bad Request           | The server cannot or will not process the request due to some client error like incorrect request syntax.                                                   |
| **401** | Unauthorized          | The client must authenticate itself to get the request response, this can occur due to an incorrect API Key or Auth token.                                  |
| **403** | Forbidden             | The client doesn't have access rights to the content/service.                                                                                               |
| **404** | Not Found             | The server can not find the requested resource. Coming from an API, it can also mean that the endpoint is correct but the requested resource doesn't exist. |
| **405** | Method Not Allowed    | The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource.                                                                      |
| **408** | Request Timeout       | A timeout means the server shut down the connection.                                                                                                        |
| **429** | Too Many Requests     | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").                                                                            |
| **500** | Internal Server Error | The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.                                                                                      |
| **501** | Not Implemented       | The request method is not supported by the server and cannot be handled.                                                                                    |
| **502** | Bad Gateway           | This error response means that the server, while acting as a gateway, tried to handle the request and got an invalid response.                              |
| **503** | Service Unavailable   | The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded.                               |
| **504** | Gateway Timeout       | This error response is given when the server is acting as a gateway and cannot get a response in time.                                                      |

## JSON-RPC Error Codes

:::info

When you make a request to a server like DataHub, the server will process your request to send back the expected response/result but in case the request does not succeed, the server will send back a response with error result fields.

Error result fields will contain the following information:

1. `code` - A Number that indicates the error type that occurred, (ex. `-32600`).

2. `message` - A String providing a short description of the error.

3. `data` - A Primitive or Structured value that contains additional information about the error. This may be omitted.

### Common JSON-RPC Error Codes

For more details about the JSON-RPC error codes and full reference, please see the official [JSON-RPC docs](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)

| Code                     | Message          | Meaning                                                                                               |
| :----------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **-32700**               | Parse error      | Invalid JSON was received by the server. An error occurred on the server while parsing the JSON text. |
| **-32600**               | Invalid Request  | The JSON sent is not a valid Request object.                                                          |
| **-32601**               | Method not found | The method does not exist / is not available.                                                         |
| **-32602**               | Invalid params   | Invalid method parameter(s).                                                                          |
| **-32603**               | Internal error   | Internal JSON-RPC error.                                                                              |
| **-32000** to **-32099** | Server error     | Reserved for implementation-defined server-errors.                                                    |
