title: 3. Create Chill Transaction
---

After collecting the required Inputs, we `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` to move on to the next step.

All data is already input so the inputs JSON is empty:

```json title="inputs"
{}
```

```text title="Example curl request"
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
  --header 'Authorization: API-KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "create_chill_tx",
  "inputs": {}
}'
```

We see two possible `actions`:

- `refresh_chill_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction Payload (ie. the nonce needs to be updated)
- `sign_chill_tx` — Submit a signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network

We will choose `sign_chill_tx``, which indicates one Input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — the signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network
