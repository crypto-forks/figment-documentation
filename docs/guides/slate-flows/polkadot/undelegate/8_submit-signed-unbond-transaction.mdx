title: 8. Submit a Signed Unbond Transaction for Broadcast
---

After signing the transaction, you will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` and Slate will manage broadcasting the transaction to the Polkadot network.

At this step, the `inputs` JSON will be:

```json title="inputs"
{
  "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
}
```

```text title="Example curl request"
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
  --header 'Authorization: API-KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "sign_unbond_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
  }
}'
```

With the signed transaction provided, Slate will broadcast it to the network. As the transaction progresses towards confirmation, the returned state will be `unbond_tx_broadcasting`.

Upon transaction finalization, the unbond will be complete and you can move on to one of the three next steps:

- If the unbonded entry _does not_ exist in the era, then it is considered `rebonded` and it moves into the `done` state
- If the unbonded entry _does_ exist and there are no funds to withdraw, it is considered unbonded and it moves into the `done` state
- If the unbonded entry _does_ exist and there are funds to withdraw, it moves into the `ready_to_withdraw` state. We will see two possible actions:
  - `create_withdraw_tx` — This proceeds with withdrawing from the account
  - `complete` — This will end the flow if we do not want to withdraw funds
