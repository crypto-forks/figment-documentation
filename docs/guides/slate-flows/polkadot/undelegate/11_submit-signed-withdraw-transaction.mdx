title: Submit a Signed Withdraw Transaction for Broadcast
---

After signing the transaction, you will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` and Slate will manage broadcasting the transaction to the Polkadot network.

At this step, the `inputs` JSON will be:

```json title="inputs"
{
  "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
}
```

```text title="Example curl request"
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://slate.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
  --header 'Authorization: API-KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "sign_withdraw_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
  }
}'
```

With the signed transaction provided, Slate will broadcast it to the network. As the transaction progresses towards confirmation, the returned state will be `withdraw_tx_broadcasting`.

Once the transaction is confirmed, the DOT will be withdrawn and this flow will be complete!

## Un-Delegation Flow Complete

Congratulations, your stake is deactivated and withdrawn!
