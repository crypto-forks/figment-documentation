title: 9. Create Withdraw Transaction
---

This transaction be created directly from initializing or after the unbonding flow.

If this is created directly after initializing, inputs will be required to gather stash account address, controller account address, and an optional controller proxy account address. Otherwise, `inputs` will not be required.

If the information **has not** been collected:

After collecting the required inputs, we `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` to move on to the next step.

In this case, the inputs JSON would be like in Step 2:

```json title="inputs"
{
  "stash_account_address": "[:stash_account_address]",
  "controller_account_address": "[:controller_account_address]",
  "controller_proxy_account_address": "[:controller_proxy_account_address]"
}
```

```text title="Example curl request"
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://slate.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
  --header 'Authorization: API-KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "create_withdraw_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "stash_account_address": "[:stash_account_address]",
    "controller_account_address": "[:controller_account_address]",
    "controller_proxy_account_address": "[:controller_proxy_account_address]"
  }
}'
```

**If this is following the flow from unbonding, no inputs are required!**

Now that the account is unbonded, submit a withdraw transaction to withdraw from the stake.

Once again, there are no required `inputs` for this.

```text title="Example curl request"
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://slate.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
  --header 'Authorization: API-KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "create_withdraw_tx",
  "inputs": {}
}'
```

**After creating the withdraw transaction, the rest will follow the same in both cases**:

We see two possible `actions`:

- `refresh_withdraw_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction Payload (ie. the nonce needs to be updated)
- `sign_withdraw_tx` — Submit a signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network

We will choose `sign_withdraw_tx`, which indicates one Input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — the signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network
