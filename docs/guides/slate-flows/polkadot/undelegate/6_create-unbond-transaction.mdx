title: 6. Create Unbond Transaction
---

Now that the account is chilled, submit an unbond transaction to unbond from the stake. Once again, there are no required inputs for this.

```json title="inputs"
{}
```

```text title="Example curl request"
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
  --header 'Authorization: API-KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "create_unbond_tx",
  "inputs": {}
}'
```

We see two possible `actions` :

- `refresh_unbond_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction Payload (ie. the nonce needs to be updated)
- `sign_unbond_tx` — Submit a signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network

We will choose `sign_unbond_tx`, which indicates one Input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — The signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network
