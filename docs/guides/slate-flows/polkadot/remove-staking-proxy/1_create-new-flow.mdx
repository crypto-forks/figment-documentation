title: Create a New Flow
---

We will create a new Flow with `POST /api/v1/flows`.

The `flow` JSON field for this request will be:

```json
{
  "network_code": "polkadot",
  "chain_code": "westend",
  "operation": "remove_proxy",
  "version": "v1"
}
```

```text
curl -X POST https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "flow": {
    "network_code": "polkadot",
    "chain_code": "westend",
    "operation": "remove_proxy",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}'
```

The response indicates one possible action:

- `create_remove_proxy_tx` - use this action to generate a proxy removal transaction.

The `create_remove_proxy_tx` action indicates two fields for data collection:

1. `proxy_account_address` (**required** )— The address from which you want to remove proxy rights.
2. `proxied_account_address` (**required**) — The account whose rights will be proxied.
