title: Submit a Signed Transaction for Broadcast
sidebar_position: 4

After signing the transaction, you will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` (as always!) and Slate will manage broadcasting the transaction to the Polkadot network.

At this step, the `inputs` will be:

```json
{
  "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
}
```

```text
curl -X PUT https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "sign_remove_proxy_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
  }
}'
```

With the signed transaction provided, Slate will broadcast it to the network. As the transaction progresses towards confirmation, the returned state will be one of:

- `remove_proxy_tx_broadcasting` — Transaction has been broadcast and is waiting confirmation.
- `removed` — Transaction has been confirmed and the proxy is revoked.
