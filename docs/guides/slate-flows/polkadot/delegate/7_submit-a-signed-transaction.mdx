title: Submit a Signed Transaction for Broadcast
---

After signing the transaction, you will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` and Slate will manage broadcasting the transaction to the Polkadot network.

At this step, the `inputs` JSON will be:

```json
{
  "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
}
```

```text
curl -X PUT https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "sign_nomination_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
  }
}'
```

And just as in Step 4, Slate will broadcast the transaction to the network.

Since nominations on Polkadot activate at the next epoch boundary (epochs are approximately 1 day), Slate will also track the nomination and send a webhook notification when it activates.
