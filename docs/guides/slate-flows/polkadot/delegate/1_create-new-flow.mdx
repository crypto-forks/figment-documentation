title: 1. Create a New Flow
---

We will create a new Flow with `POST /api/v1/flows`.

The `flow` JSON field for this request will be:

```json
{
  "network_code": "polkadot",
  "chain_code": "westend",
  "operation": "staking",
  "version": "v1"
}
```

```text
curl -X POST https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "flow": {
    "network_code": "polkadot",
    "chain_code": "westend",
    "operation": "staking",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}'
```

The response indicates two possible actions:

- `assign_stash_and_controller_account` — Use this action if you already have a controller account set up and wish to add bond to it.
- `create_bonding_tx` — Use this action if you do not have a controller account set up and would like to create a controller and bond tokens.

:::info

If you want to skip creating a stash / controller relationship, you will use the assign_stash_and_controller_account action and skip to step (?)

:::

Since we want to create a new controller relationship, we will use the `create_bonding_tx` action which indicates six fields for data collection:

1. `controller_account_address` (**required**) - The wallet DOT will be bonded to.
2. `controller_proxy_account_address` (_optional_) - A proxy account that will sign on behalf of the controller account.
3. `stash_ account_address` (**required**) - Primary wallet from which DOT will be bonded.
4. `stash_proxy_account_address` (_optional_) - A proxy account that will sign on behalf of the controller account.
5. `reward_destination` (**required**) - Indicates whether rewards are to be:
   - Added to the staked balance (`staked`)
   - Sent to the controller account, liquid (`controller`)
   - Sent to the stash account, liquid (`stash`)
6. `amount` (**required**) - The amount of DOT to be bonded to the controller. This field should be in full DOT, not in Planck (ie. if you want to stake 5 DOT, return `"amount": 5.0`). Slate will translate the amount to Plancks so you do not have to worry about the conversion factor.
