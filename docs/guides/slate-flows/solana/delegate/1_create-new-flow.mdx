title: Create a New Flow
---

We will create a new Flow with `POST /api/v1/flows`.

The `flow` JSON field for this request will be:

```json
{
  "network_code": "solana",
  "chain_code": "devnet",
  "operation": "staking",
  "version": "v1"
}
```

```text
curl -X POST https://solana-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "flow": {
    "network_code": "solana",
    "chain_code": "devnet",
    "operation": "staking",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}'
```

The response indicates two possible actions:

- `assign_stake_account` — Use this action if you already have an inactive stake account you want to activate.
- `create_new_stake_account` — Use this action if you do not have an inactive stake account and want to create a new one.

Since we want to create a new Stake Account, we will use the second action. The `create_new_stake_account` action indicates 4 fields for data collection:

1. `funding_account_pubkey` (**required**) - The main wallet your SOL will be originating from.
2. `stake_authority_pubkey` (_optional_) - Grants authority to sign certain staking relation transactions to the provided address. Defaults to `funding_account_pubkey`.
3. `withdraw_authority_pubkey` (_optional_) - Grants authority to sign certain withdrawal related transactions to the provided address. Defaults to `funding_account_pubkey`.
4. `amount` (**required**) - The amount of SOL to be sent to the Stake Account. This field should be in full SOL, not in lamports (i.e. if you want to stake 5 SOL, return `"amount": 5.0`). Slate will translate the amount to lamports so you do not have to worry about the conversion factor.
