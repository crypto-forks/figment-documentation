title: Submit Withdrawl Transaction Data
---

After receiving the deactivation webhook, a query to `GET /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` will return the following response:

```json
{
  "id": "[:id]",
  "state": "deactivated",
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "create_withdraw_tx",
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name": "amount",
          "description": "",
          "type": "decimal",
          "validations": [
            {
              "type": "presence",
              "options": {}
            },
            {
              "type": "numericality",
              "options": {
                "greater_than": 0
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "funding_account_pubkey",
          "description": "",
          "type": "string",
          "validations": []
        },
        {
          "name": "recipient_pubkey",
          "description": "",
          "type": "string",
          "validations": [
            {
              "type": "presence",
              "options": {}
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "data": {},
  "network_code": "solana",
  "chain_code": "devnet",
  "created_at": "[:date_time]",
  "updated_at": "[:date_time]"
}
```

We see there is one Action — `create_withdraw_tx` — and three required fields:

- `amount` (**required**) — the number of SOL to be withdrawn. Partial withdrawal is possible.
- `funding_account_pubkey` (**required**) — The address of the account that will pay the transaction fee.
- `recipient_pubkey` (**required**) — The address of the wallet to which the withdrawn SOL will be sent.

:::info

**IMPORTANT**: Note that the recipient of the withdrawal is _not_ the originating address by default!

:::

Once this data has been collected we submit it to Slate with `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` and the following `inputs` JSON:

```json
{
  "amount": "[:amount]",
  "funding_account_pubkey": "[:funding_account_pubkey]",
  "recipient_pubkey": "[:recipient_pubkey]"
}
```

```text
curl -X PUT https://slate-staging.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "create_withdraw_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "amount": "[:amount]",
    "funding_account_pubkey": "[:funding_account_pubkey]",
    "recipient_pubkey": "[:recipient_pubkey]"
  }
}'
```

Note that, in this response, you can find the unsigned, serialized transaction in `data[create_withdraw_transaction][raw]`.

There are two possible `actions`:

- `refresh_withdraw_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction Payload (i.e., the recent blockhash has expired)
- `sign_withdraw_tx` — Submit a signed transaction payload ready to be broadcast to the network.

We will choose `sign_withdraw_tx`, which indicates one Input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — The signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.
