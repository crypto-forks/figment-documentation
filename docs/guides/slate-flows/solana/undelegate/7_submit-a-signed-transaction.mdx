title: Submit a Signed Withdrawl Transaction for Broadcast
---

After signing the transaction, you will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` and Slate will manage broadcasting the transaction to the Solana network.

At this step, the `inputs` JSON will be:

```json
{
  "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
}
```

And just as in Step 4, Slate will broadcast the transaction to the network.

Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain, the SOL will be available in the recipient account and this flow will be complete!

## Un-Delegation Flow Complete

Congratulations, your stake is deactivated and withdrawn to your main wallet!

:::info

If you only withdrew a portion of the stake account balance and wish to reactivate the remaining portion, simply start a new staking flow on Solana and use the `assign_stake_account` action in the first step.
