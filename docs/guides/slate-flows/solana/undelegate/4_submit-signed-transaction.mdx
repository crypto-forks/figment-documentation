title: Submit a Signed Transaction for Broadcast
sidebar_position: 4
---

After signing the transaction, you will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` (as always!) and Slate will manage broadcasting the transaction to the Solana network.

At this step, the `inputs` JSON will be:

```json
{
  "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
}
```

```text
curl -X PUT https://solana-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "sign_deactivate_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
  }
}'
```

With the signed transaction provided, Slate will broadcast it to the network. As the transaction progresses towards confirmation, the returned state will be one of:

- `deactivate_tx_broadcasting` - Transaction has been broadcast but not confirmed.
- next state?

Upon transaction finalization, the stake account will start the process of deactivating. This generally happens at the next epoch boundary (max 2.5 days), but if there is a large change in network wide delegation levels it is possible it will be subjected to a multi-epoch cooldown period. This would mean that a portion of the stake will deactivate at each epoch boundary for a few epochs until it is fully deactivated.

You can read more about warmup and cooldown period here: https://docs.solana.com/cluster/stake-delegation-and-rewards#stake-warmup-cooldown-withdrawal

:::

At each epoch, a webhook notifies you about how much of the stake has deactivated until it is fully deactivated.

At this point, you are ready to move on to the next step â€” Submit Withdrawal Transaction Data collection.
