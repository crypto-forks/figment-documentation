title: Submit Signed Transaction for Broadcast
---

After signing the transaction, you will PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next (as always!) and Slate will manage broadcasting the transaction to the NEAR network.

At this step, the `inputs` JSON will be:

```json
{
  "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
}
```

```text
curl -X PUT https://near-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "sign_delegate_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
  }
}'
```

With the signed transaction provided, Slate will broadcast it to the network. As the transaction progresses towards confirmation, the returned state will be one of:

- `delegate_tx_broadcasting` — Transaction has been broadcast and confirmed.
- `delegated` — Transaction has been confirmed.

## Delegation Flow Complete

Congratulations, your delegation is now active and earning rewards!
