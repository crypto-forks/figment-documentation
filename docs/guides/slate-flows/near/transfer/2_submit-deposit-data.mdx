title: Submit Deposit Data
---

After collecting the required Inputs, we `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` to move on to the next step. In this case, the inputs JSON would be:

```json
{
  "funding_account_address": "[:funding_account_address]",
  "validator_pub_key": "[:validator_pub_key]",
  "withdrawal_credentials": "[:withdrawal_credentials]",
  "signature": "[:signature]",
  "deposit_data_root": "[:deposit_data_root]"
}
```

```text
curl -X PUT https://near-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "create_deposit_transaction",
  "inputs": {
    "funding_account_address": "[:funding_account_address]",
    "validator_pub_key": "[:validator_pub_key]",
    "withdrawal_credentials": "[:withdrawal_credentials]",
    "signature": "[:signature]",
    "deposit_data_root": "[:deposit_data_root]"
  }
}'
```

Note that in this response you can find the unsigned, serialized transaction in `data[create_deposit_transaction][raw]`.

Again we see two possible `actions` :

- `refresh_deposit_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction Payload (i.e., the nonce has increased).
- `sign_deposit_tx` — Submit a signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.

We will choose `sign_deposit_tx`, which indicates one Input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — The signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.
