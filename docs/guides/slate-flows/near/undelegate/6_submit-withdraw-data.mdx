title: Submit Withdraw Data
---

After collecting the required inputs, we `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` to move on to the next step.

In this case, the `inputs` JSON would be:

```json
{
  "validator_address": "[:validator_address]",
  "delegator_address": "[:delegator_address]",
  "delegator_pubkey": "[:delegator_pubkey]",
  "withdraw_amount": "[:withdraw_amount]"
}
```

```text
curl -X PUT https://near-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "create_withdraw_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "validator_address": "[:validator_address]",
    "delegator_address": "[:delegator_address]",
    "delegator_pubkey": "[:delegator_pubkey]",
    "withdraw_amount": "[:withdraw_amount]"
  }
}'
```

We see two possible `actions`:

- `refresh_withdraw_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction payload (i.e., if the nonce needs to be updated)
- `sign_withdraw_tx` — Submit a signed transaction payload ready to be broadcast to the network.

We will choose `sign_withdraw_tx`, which indicates one input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — The signed transaction payload ready to be broadcast to the network.
