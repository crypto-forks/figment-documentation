title: Create a New Flow
---

We will create a new Flow with `POST /api/v1/flows`.

The `flow` JSON field for this request will be:

```json
{
  "network_code": "solana",
  "chain_code": "devnet",
  "operation": "unstaking",
  "version": "v1"
}
```

```text
curl -X POST https://solana-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "flow": {
    "network_code": "solana",
    "chain_code": "devnet",
    "operation": "unstaking",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}'
```

The response indicates one possible action:

- `create_deactivate_tx` — Collect the data needed to build a stake deactivation transaction and submit back to the Staking API.

As you can see, this Action indicates two fields need to be provided:

- `stake_account_pubkey` (**required**) — The address of the stake account to be deactivated.
- `funding_account_pubkey` (**required**) — The address of the wallet with signing rights to deactivate the stake account.
