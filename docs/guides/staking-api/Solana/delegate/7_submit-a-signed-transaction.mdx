title: Submit a Signed Transaction for Broadcast
---

After signing the transaction, you will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` and the Staking API will manage broadcasting the transaction to the Solana network.

At this step, the `inputs` JSON will be:

```json
{
  "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
}
```

```text
curl --request PUT https://solana-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "sign_delegate_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
  }
}'
```

And just as in Step 4, Staking API will broadcast the transaction to the network.

Since delegations on Solana activate at the next epoch boundary (epochs are approximately 2.5 days), Staking API will also track the delegation and send a webhook notification when it activates.

It is possible the delegation will be subjected to a multi-epoch warmup period, in which case you will receive a webhook at each epoch notifying you how much has been activated until the full amount is active.

Congratulations, your stake is now active and earning rewards!
