title: Submit Staking Account Data
---

After collecting the required Inputs, we `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` to move on to the next step. In this case, the inputs JSON would be:

```json
{
  "from_account_pubkey": "[:from_account_pubkey]",
  "to_account_pubkey": "[:to_account_pubkey]",
  "amount": "[:amount]"
}
```

```text
curl -X PUT https://solana-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "create_transfer_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "from_account_pubkey": "[:from_account_pubkey]",
    "to_account_pubkey": "[:to_account_pubkey]",
    "amount": "[:amount]"
  }
}'
```

We see two possible `actions`:

- `refresh_transfer_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction Payload (i.e., the recent blockhash has expired).
- `sign_transfer_tx` — Submit a signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.

We will choose `sign_transfer_tx`, which indicates one Input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — The signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.
