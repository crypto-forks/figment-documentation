title: Create a New Flow
---

We will create a new Flow with a `POST` request to `/api/v1/flows`.

The `flow` JSON field for this request will be:

```json
{
  "network_code": "ethereum",
  "chain_code": "goerli-prater",
  "operation": "staking",
  "version": "v1"
}
```

```text
curl -X POST https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "flow": {
    "network_code": "ethereum",
    "chain_code": "goerli-prater",
    "operation": "staking",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}'
```

The response indicates two possible actions:

- `assign_unstaking_data` — use this action if you want to unbond (optionally preceeded by chilling and then followed by optional withdrawing).
- `create_withdraw_tx` — use this action if you want to withdraw _without_ unbonding.

Since we want to unbond, we will use action 1.

The `assign_unstaking_data` action indicates 5 fields for data collection:

1. `stash_account_address` (**required**) — the wallet DOT is bonded to
2. `controller_account_address` (**required**) — the account that controls the staking/unstaking actions. This is the account that will sign transactions
3. `controller_proxy_account_address` (**optional**) — a proxy account that can sign on behalf of the controller account
4. `amount` (**required**) - the amount of DOT to be unbonded from the controller. This field should be in full DOT, not in Planck (ie. if you want to stake 5 DOT, return `"amount": 5.0`). The Staking API will translate the amount to Plancks so you do not have to worry about the conversion factor
5. `maximum` (**optional**) - this boolean indicates if all bonded funds should be unbonded

If the account does not need to be chilled, you can skip to [Create Unbond Transaction](/guides/staking-api/polkadot/undelegate/create-unbond-transaction)

If you want to skip the unbonding process as well, you can skip to [Create Withdraw Transaction](/guides/staking-api/polkadot/undelegate/create-withdraw-transaction)
