title: Submit Nomination Addresses
---

Now that the bond is created, submit a nomination transaction to activate the stake. The previous response indicates one required input:

- `validator_addresses` (**required**) — An array containing the address(es) of the validator(s) to which the DOT will be delegated.

:::info

You may nominate anywhere from 1 to 16 validators on the Polkadot network. Your DOT will be distributed automatically by the network in the most efficient way at each epoch.

:::

As in each step, we will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` with the following inputs:

```json
{
  "validator_addresses": "[:validator_addresses]"
}
```

```
curl -X PUT https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "create_nomination_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "validator_addresses": "[:validator_addresses]"
  }
}'
```

As in Step 2, note that in this response you can find the unsigned, serialized transaction in `data[create_nomination_tx][raw]`.

There are two possible actions:

- `refresh_nomination_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction Payload.
- `sign_nomination_tx` — Submit a signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.

We will choose `sign_nomination_tx`, so note that it indicates one Input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — The signed transaction payload ready to be broadcast to the network.
