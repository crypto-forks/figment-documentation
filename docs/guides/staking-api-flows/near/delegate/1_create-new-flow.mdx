title: Create New Flow
---

We will create a new Flow with `POST /api/v1/flows`.

The `flow` JSON field for this request will be:

```json
{
  "network_code": "near",
  "chain_code": "testnet",
  "operation": "staking",
  "version": "v1"
}
```

```text
curl -X POST https://near-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "flow": {
    "network_code": "near",
    "chain_code": "testnet",
    "operation": "staking",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}'
```

The response indicates one possible action:

- `create_delegate_tx` - use this action to generate a delegation transaction to stake your NEAR.

The `create_delegate_tx` action indicates five fields for data collection:

- `validator_address` (**required**) — Figment validator address.
- `delegator_address` (**required**) — The delegating address.
- `delegator_pubkey` (**required**) — The public key of the signing account. Must start with `ed25519:`
- `amount` (**required**) — The amount of NEAR to be delegated.
- `max_gas` (_optional_) — Adjust if you wish to limit the possible transaction fee.
