title: Submit Un-Delegate Data
---

After collecting the required Inputs, we `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` to move on to the next step. In this case, the inputs JSON would be:

```json
{
  "validator_address": "[:validator_address]",
  "delegator_address": "[:delegator_address]",
  "delegator_pubkey": "[:delegator_pubkey]",
  "undelegate_amount": "[:undelegate_amount]"
}
```

```text
curl -X PUT https://near-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "create_undelegate_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "validator_address": "[:validator_address]",
    "delegator_address": "[:delegator_address]",
    "delegator_pubkey": "[:delegator_pubkey]",
    "undelegate_amount": "[:undelegate_amount]"
  }
}'
```

We see two possible `actions` :

- `refresh_undelegate_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction Payload (i.e., the nonce has increased).
- `sign_undelegate_tx` — Submit a signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.

We will choose `sign_undelegate_tx`, which indicates one Input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — The signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.
