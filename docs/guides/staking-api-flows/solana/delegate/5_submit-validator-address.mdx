title: Submit Validator Address
---

Now that the stake account is created, submit a delegation transaction to activate the stake. The previous response indicates one required input:

- `validator_address` (**required**) — The vote address of the validator to which the SOL will be delegated.

As in each step, we will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` with the following `inputs`:

```json
{
  "validator_address": "[:validator_address]"
}
```

```text
curl -X PUT https://solana-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "create_delegate_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "validator_address": "[:validator_address]"
  }
}'
```

As in Step 2, note that in this response you can find the unsigned, serialized transaction in `data[create_delegate_tx][raw]`.

There are two possible `actions`:

- `refresh_delegate_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction Payload.
- `sign_delegate_tx` — Submit a signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.

We will chose `sign_delegate_tx`, so note that it indicates one Input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — The signed transaction payload ready to be broadcast to the network.
