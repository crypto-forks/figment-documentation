title: Submit a Signed Transaction for Broadcast
sidebar_position: 4

After signing the transaction, you will `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` (as always!) and the Staking API will manage broadcasting the transaction to the Solana network.

At this step, the `inputs` JSON will be:

```json
{
  "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
}
```

```text
curl -X PUT https://solana-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "sign_stake_account_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "transaction_payload": "[:signed_transaction_payload]"
  }
}'
```

With the signed transaction provided, Staking API will broadcast it to the network. As the transaction progresses towards confirmation, the returned `state` will be either:

- `stake_account_tx_broadcasting` — Transaction has been broadcast but not confirmed.
- next state?

Upon transaction finalization, the stake account will be ready for the next step — the delegation transaction!
