title: Create a New Flow
---

We will create a new Flow with `POST /api/v1/flows`.

The `flow` JSON field for this request will be:

```json
{
  "network_code": "solana",
  "chain_code": "devnet",
  "operation": "transfer",
  "version": "v1"
}
```

```text
curl -X POST https://solana-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "flow": {
    "network_code": "solana",
    "chain_code": "devnet",
    "operation": "transfer",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}'
```

The response indicates one possible action:

- `create_transfer_tx` - use this action to generate a deposit transaction to stake your ETH.

The `create_transfer_tx` action indicates four fields for data collection:

1. `funding_account_pubkey` (_optional_) - pubkey of the wallet which will pay the transaction fee.
2. `from_account_pubkey` (**required**) - main wallet your SOL will be originating from.
3. `to_account_pubkey` (**required**) - the withdrawal address for the given validator.
4. `amount` (**required**) â€” The amount of SOL to be transferred to the account. This field should be in full SOL, not in lamports (ie. if you want to transfer 5 SOL, return `"amount": 5.0`). The Staking API will translate the amount to lamports so you do not have to worry about the conversion factor.
