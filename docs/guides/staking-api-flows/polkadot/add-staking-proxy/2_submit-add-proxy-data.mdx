title: Submit the Add Proxy Data
---

After collecting the required Inputs, we `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` to move on to the next step. In this case, the inputs JSON would be:

```json
{
  "proxy_account_address": "[:proxy_account_address]",
  "proxied_account_address": "[:proxied_account_address]"
}
```

```text
curl -X PUT https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
-H "Authorization: API-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "create_add_proxy_tx",
  "inputs": {
    "proxy_account_address": "[:proxy_account_address]",
    "proxied_account_address": "[:proxied_account_address]",
  }
}'
```

We see two possible `actions`:

- `refresh_add_proxy_tx` — If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction Payload (i.e., the nonce has increased).
- `sign_add_proxy_tx` — Submit a signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.

We will choose `sign_add_proxy_tx`, which indicates one Input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` (**required**) — The signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.
