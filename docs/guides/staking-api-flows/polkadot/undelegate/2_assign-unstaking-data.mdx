title: Assign Unstaking Data
---

After collecting the required Inputs, we `PUT /api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` to move on to the next step.

In this case, the `inputs` JSON would be:

```json title="inputs"
{
  "controller_account_address": "[:controller_account_address]",
  "stash_account_address": "[:stash_account_address]",
  "controller_proxy_account_address": "[:controller_proxy_account_address]",
  "amount": "[:amount]",
  "maximum": "[:maximum]"
}
```

```text title="Example curl request"
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://polkadot-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next \
  --header 'Authorization: API-KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "assign_unstaking_data",
  "inputs": {
    "controller_account_address": "[:controller_account_address]",
    "stash_account_address": "[:stash_account_address]",
    "controller_proxy_account_address": "[:controller_proxy_account_address]",
    "amount": "[:amount]",
    "maximum": "[:maximum]"
  }
}'
```

If chilling is required before unbonding, we will be required to create a chill transaction: [3. Create Chill Transaction](/guides/staking-api-flows/polkadot/undelegate/create-chill-transaction)

If no chilling is required, we can move straight to creating the unbond transaction: [6. Create Unbond Transaction](/guides/staking-api-flows/polkadot/undelegate/create-unbond-transaction)
