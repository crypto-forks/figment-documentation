## Link a Subgraph to your App

From the Dashboard, click on your App then click on the **Subgraphs** tab.

<img
  src={img1}
  alt="Subgraphs"
  width="400"
  className="shadow--tl inline-image"
/>

Here you can view your linked Subgraphs if you have any, and click **Link Subgraph** to add a new Subgraph to your App. You will need to deploy your Subgraph to the Graph Explorer first. Simply paste your Subgraph ID then click **Add**.

<img
  src={img2}
  alt="Link a Subgraph"
  width="400"
  className="shadow--tl inline-image"
/>

You can now see any linked Subgraphs:

<img
  src={img3}
  alt="Subgraph Added"
  width="400"
  className="shadow--tl inline-image"
/>

Clicking on a Subgraph displays details of that Subgraph including its **Status** and Engagement metrics like **Query Fees**, **Signal** and **Stake**. Below that is a table of both **Indexers** and **Curators**.

<img
  src={img4}
  alt="Subgraph Details"
  width="400"
  className="shadow--tl inline-image"
/>
