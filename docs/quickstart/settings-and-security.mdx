## App General Settings

From the Dashboard, click on an App then click on the **Settings** tab.

Here you can:

- Edit your App name and environment
- View your subscription breakdown
- Add or change your payment method
- View details about your past invoices

### Allowed Origins

To comply with our default CORS policy, you need to explicitly allow any domains that could be a part of a cross-origin request.
We use `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers, populated by the Allowed Origins set here. You can add multiple domains, according to the needs of your app.

### What is CORS?

**C**ross-**O**rigin **R**esource **S**haring (**[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)**) is an HTTP-header-based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other _origin_ (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit the loading of resources.

### CORS Request Example

:::info

For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts.

:::

An example of a cross-origin request:

- The front-end JavaScript code served from https://domain-a.com uses `XMLHttpRequest` to make a request for https://domain-b.com/data.json.

## CORS Error Example

CORS Errors could occur when you're working with APIs and it's important to handle them effectively due to security reasons.

```text title="CORS Error Example"
Access to fetch at 'https://solana--mainnet--rpc.datahub.figment.io/'
from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy:
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check:
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested
resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's
mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
```

:::warning

Although the error message says:

> If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

We recommend that you **_do not_** attempt to disable CORS when making requests via Figment endpoints.

## Add Allowed Origin

1. Navigate to your App Security settings.
2. In the **Allowed Origins** section, add a domain address that includes protocol (http, https, wss), hostname, and an optional port number. Example: `http://localhost:3000` or `https://appdomain.xyz` or `wss://uniswap.org`.
3. Click **Save** and save your changes to the Allowed Origins list. _If you see errors upon saving_ you need to fix them first and click **Save** to revalidate and save your changes.

## Delete Allowed Origin

1. Navigate to your App Security settings.
2. In the **Allowed Origins** section, delete a domain address by clicking on the trashcan icon to the right of the URL.
3. Click **Save** to save your changes to the Allowed Origins list.

### Adding Collaborators

1. Click on **Add Collaborator** to open a modal view which allows you to add the email address you are inviting to your team. There is a dropdown to select the role you want to assign them once they accept the invitation.
2. The status will show as _Pending_ until the invite is accepted.
3. Once the invite is accepted, the Collaborator will be visible in the list and they will have the assigned role.

### Deleting Collaborators

1. From the **Team Settings**, locate the Collaborator you want to delete in the list, then click the three dots on the right side of their card to reveal the Delete action. Clicking it will immediately remove that Collaborator from your App.
