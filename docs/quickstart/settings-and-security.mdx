## App General Settings

From the Dashboard, click on an app then select the **Settings** tab.

Here you can:

- Edit your app name and environment
- View your subscription breakdown
- Add or change your payment method
- View details about your past invoices

### Allowed Origins

To comply with our default CORS policy, you need to explicitly allow any domains that could be a part of a cross-origin request.
We use `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers, populated by the Allowed Origins set here. You can add multiple domains, according to the needs of your app.

### CORS

**C**ross-**O**rigin **R**esource **S**haring (**[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)**) is an HTTP header-based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origin (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit the loading of resources.

### CORS Request Example

:::info

For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts.

:::

An example of a cross-origin request:

- The front-end JavaScript code served from https://domain-a.com uses `XMLHttpRequest` to make a request for https://domain-b.com/data.json.

## CORS Error Example

CORS errors may occur when you're working with APIs. It's important to handle them effectively due to security reasons.

```text title="CORS Error Example"
Access to fetch at 'https://solana--mainnet--rpc.datahub.figment.io/'
from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy:
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check:
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested
resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's
mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
```

:::caution

Although the error message says:

> If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

We recommend that you **_do not_** attempt to disable CORS when making requests via Figment endpoints.

## Add Allowed Origin

1. Navigate to your app's **Security** settings.
2. In the **Allowed Origins** section, add a domain address that includes protocol (http, https, wss), hostname, and an optional port number. Example: `http://localhost:3000` or `https://appdomain.xyz` or `wss://uniswap.org`.
3. Click **Save** and save your changes to the Allowed Origins list. _If you see errors upon saving_ you need to fix them first and click **Save** to revalidate and save your changes.

## Delete Allowed Origin

1. Navigate to your app's **Security** settings.
2. In the **Allowed Origins** section, delete a domain address by clicking on the trashcan icon to the right of the URL.
3. Click **Save** to save your changes to the Allowed Origins list.

### Adding Collaborators

Clicking on **Add Collaborator** opens a modal view. Add the email address you are inviting to your team. There is a dropdown to select the role you want to assign them once they accept the invitation. Their status will show as **Pending**. Once the invite is accepted, the collaborator and their role will be visible in the list.

### Deleting Collaborators

On the list of collaborators, select the one you want to delete. Click the three dots on the right side of their card to reveal the **Delete** action. Clicking it will immediately remove that collaborator from your app.
